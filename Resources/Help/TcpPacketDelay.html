<h3>TCP Packet Delay Help</h3><br>
A network covert channel is a mechanism that can be used
to leak information across a network in violation of a security 
policy and in a manner that can be dificult to detect.
Specific in the Tcp Packet Delay Covert Channel we can hide 
information on the distance time between two continues packets.
For example if the time between two continues packets is less than 100ms 
we assume that transmited the bit zero, in addition if the above time is 
more than 100 we assume that transmeted the bit one.

<li>If some values of the above table reduce, the transmition may occure some erorrs.</li>
<li>Its  also recommended the field 'Silent Interval' always checked to dismish synchronization problems which involves transmition errors.</li>
