<h3>Interval Adjusting Help</h3><br>
This is a method to solve Synchronization Problem.
Rather than slow down the transmission by introducing
silent periods in which no transfer occurs, the channel can
adapt to the changes gradually as the network conditions
change. In our interval adjusting scheme, the receiver closely
monitors the time each packet arrives and compares it to the
projected ideal case (the expected arrival time of the next
packet) based on the current timing interval. Comparing the
two, a delta is computed, which is the deviation between the
ideal and actual times. The receiver then simply adds this
value to its timing interval and adjusts its clock for the next
arriving packet. Note that delta can be positive or negative,
depending on whether the packet arrived early or late. This
scheme is most useful when there is an incremental change
in the network conditions that persists for longer than the
lifetime of a single packet. It can however lead to errors
if the change in the network delay is greater than 50% of
the timing interval.
