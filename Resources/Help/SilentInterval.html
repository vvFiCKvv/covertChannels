<h3>Silent Interval Help</h3><br>
This is a method to solve Synchronization Problem.
We enhance the scheme by introducing silent in-
tervals between frames. During a silent interval no packet
transfer occurs between sender and receiver. We assume
that the parties have previously determined the length of
the silent interval. This interval can either be a default value
or the covert channel itself can be initially used to send this
value before the actual data transfer begins. The sender
can enter the silent state any time during the transmission.
Note that the sender has no way of knowing whether the
receiver received the covert bits correctly or not.
