This is a method to solve Synchronization Problem.
As a precaution against low levels of jitter in the network,
each packet is sent in the middle of the timing interval.
Moreover, upon receipt of every SOF packet, the receiver
aligns itself with the newly received SOF by assuming that
the SOF arrived exactly in the middle of the timing interval.
This aligns the sender and receiver timing windows and in
turn helps maintain synchronization.
