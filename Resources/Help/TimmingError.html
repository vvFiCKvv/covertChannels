<h3>Timming Error Help</h3><br>
it is the space time that any time variance can deflect withowt any change in the behavior of the Covert Channel.
For example if the <a href = "res://zerobitdelay" >Zero Bit Delay</a> time is 200ms and the Timming Error is 80ms then, 
we rerpresent a zero bit for each two continues packages that the space time
is more than 120ms and less than 280ms.

For more error resistance the Timing Error must be equals with the half of the diference between 
<a href = "res://onebitdelay" >One Bit Delay</a> and <a href = "res://zerobitdelay" >Zero Bit Delay</a> <br>
Timing Error = (One Bit Delay - Zero Bit Delay )/2
