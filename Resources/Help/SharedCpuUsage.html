<h3>Shared Cpu Usage</h3><br>
A covert channel using a Shares CPU is a mechanism that can be used to leak information across two process which shares a common CPU.
<br>Specifically the usage and the disuse of the CPU can be used as the trasmition of a bit. 
<br>Furthermore we can use timeslots for the transmition sinchronazation between Sprocesses.
<br>Shared CPU Covert Channel is a noisy Covert Channel. For that reason we can use techniques like error correction code to eliminate the transmition errors.
